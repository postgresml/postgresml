Description: PostgresML - machine learning with PostgreSQL
 PostgresML is a PostgreSQL extension that allows to do machine
 learning directly in the database. It allows to both train
 algorithms on tables or views, and to predict novel datapoints
 using only SQL.
 The extension is written in Rust using tcdi/pgrx with some additional
 functionality written in Python & PlPython.
