PostgresML makes it easy to use machine learning with your database and to scale workloads horizontally in our cloud. Our SDK makes it even easier.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>HNSW (hierarchical navigable small worlds) is an indexing method that greatly improves vector recall</p></figcaption></figure>

## Introducing HNSW

Underneath the hood our SDK utilizes [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) to store, index, and recall vectors. Up until this point our SDK used IVFFlat indexing to divide vectors into lists, search a subset of those lists, and return the closest vector matches.

While the IVFFlat indexing method is fast, it is not as fast as HNSW. Thanks to the latest update of [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) our SDK now utilizes HNSW indexing, creating multi-layer graphs instead of lists and removing the required training step IVFFlat imposed.

The results are not disappointing.

## Comparing HNSW and IVFFlat

In one of our previous posts: Tuning vector recall while generating query embeddings in the database we were working on a dataset with over 5 million Amazon Movie Reviews, and after embedding the reviews, performed semantic similarity search to get the closest 5 reviews.

Let's run that query again:

!!! generic

!!! code\_block time="89.118 ms"

```postgresql
WITH request AS (
  SELECT pgml.embed(
    'intfloat/e5-large',
    'query: Best 1980''s scifi movie'
  )::vector(1024) AS embedding
)

SELECT
  id,
  1 - (
    review_embedding_e5_large <=> (
      SELECT embedding FROM request
    )
  ) AS cosine_similarity
FROM pgml.amazon_us_reviews
ORDER BY review_embedding_e5_large <=> (SELECT embedding FROM request)
LIMIT 5;
```

!!!

This query utilized IVFFlat indexing and queried through over 5 million rows in 89.118ms. Pretty fast!

Let's drop our IVFFlat index and create an HNSW index.

!!! code\_block time="10255099.233 ms (02:50:55.099)"

```postgresql
DROP INDEX index_amazon_us_reviews_on_review_embedding_e5_large;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON pgml.amazon_us_reviews USING hnsw (review_embedding_e5_large vector_cosine_ops);
```

!!!

Now let's try the query again utilizing the new HNSW index we created.

!!! generic

!!! code\_block time="17.465 ms"

```postgresql
WITH request AS (
  SELECT pgml.embed(
    'intfloat/e5-large',
    'query: Best 1980''s scifi movie'
  )::vector(1024) AS embedding
)

SELECT
  id,
  1 - (
    review_embedding_e5_large <=> (
      SELECT embedding FROM request
    )
  ) AS cosine_similarity
FROM pgml.amazon_us_reviews
ORDER BY review_embedding_e5_large <=> (SELECT embedding FROM request)
LIMIT 5;
```

Not only are the results better (the `cosine_similarity` is higher overall), but HNSW is over 5x faster, reducing our search and embedding time to 17.465ms.

This is a massive upgrade to the recall speed utilized by our SDK and greatly improves overall performance.
