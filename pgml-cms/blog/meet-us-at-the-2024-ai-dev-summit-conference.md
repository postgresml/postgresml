Our own Silas Marvin will be hosting a session about performing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with our JS and Python SDKs. Our senior team will also be at our booth at all hours to get to know you, talk shop, and answer any questions you may have about PostgresML, RAG, machine learning, or all the sweet merch we’ll have on deck. 

If you’d like some 1:1 time with our team at the conference you can [contact us here](https://postgresml.org/contact) or on Discord. We’d be happy to prep something special for you. 

So, why sit on the sidelines when you could be right in the thick of it, soaking up knowledge, making connections, and maybe even stumbling upon your next big breakthrough? Clear your schedule, grab your ticket, and get ready to geek out with us at [AI DevSummit](https://aidevsummit.co/). 

See you there!
