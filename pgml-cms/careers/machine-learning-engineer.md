# Machine Learning Engineer

PostgresML provides microsecond inference with the world's most capable feature store. It allows you to easily train and deploy online models using only SQL. We're looking for a experienced Machine Learning Engineers to help shape the core product, inside and out. This is an IC role, but will be critical in building the future team as well as the core product, while leading efforts toward more efficient and effective Machine Learning workflows for our customers.

Reach out if you want to:

* Work with an engineering team to implement ML solutions at scale
* Build an infrastructure platform across multiple cloud providers
* Integrate the latest models and frameworks w/ vector and tabular database operations
* Diagnose customer scale and performance issues

### About Us

We're a Seed stage startup with experienced software engineers and designers who specialize broadly across the skillsets required to build machine learning infrastructure. We use Rust to operate within Postgres for memory efficiency and performance at scale with standard supervised learning libraries, such as Torch, Tensorflow and XGBoost, to build a hosted, horizontally scalable platform on top of Postgres.

We bias toward action and course correct based on feedback. We're not afraid of failure, we're always learning. We enjoy working on big problems with a pragmatic approach, participating in the broader open source community.
