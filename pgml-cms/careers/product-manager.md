# Product Manager

PostgresML provides cloud hosted AI application databases, that bring the latest machine learning and vector capabilities to the heart of everyone’s favorite tech stack. We're looking for a Head of Growth, with a Technical Product Manager skill set to help shape the core product, inside and outside the company.

Reach out if you want to:

* Work on a small team with designers and engineers to create intuitive user experiences
* Research a rapidly developing market, and design the foundation of next gen data infrastructure
* Work directly with users to understand their needs and formalize product requirements
* Develop Sales & Marketing strategy aligned with Research & Development

### About Us

We're a Seed stage startup with experienced software engineers and designers who specialize broadly across the skillsets required to build machine learning infrastructure. We use Rust to operate within Postgres for memory efficiency and performance at scale with standard supervised learning libraries, such as Torch, Tensorflow and XGBoost, to build a hosted, horizontally scalable platform on top of Postgres.

We bias toward action and course correct based on feedback. We're not afraid of failure, we're always learning. We enjoy working on big problems with a pragmatic approach, participating in the broader open source community.

* Bachelor’s degree in computer science, human-computer interaction, interaction design, or a related field
* 7+ years of product management and/or software engineering experience
* Experience with databases, machine learning, and software development in practice

### Benefits

We take care of our team and care about your well being.

* Remote-first, work from anywhere in the United States
* We cover the max allowable (99%) health, dental and vision premiums for platinum tier insurance plans
* $5k/year hardware budget, $500/month home office reimbursement as well as conference, learning and development stipend
* If you live in the Bay Area, we hike and hang out every Wednesday. We prefer that to Zoom, so we’ll offer you a relocation package if you’re interested in the beautiful weather.
* Unlimited PTO, and we strongly encourage you to use it to stay healthy and happy. It's typical for employees to take 3-4 weeks per year, in addition to holidays.

### Employment Eligibility

You must be eligible to work in the United States.
