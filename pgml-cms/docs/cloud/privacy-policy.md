**Information We Collect Automatically.**  We automatically log information about you and your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Site and the Services.  For example, when visiting our Site or using the Services, we may log your computer or device identification, operating system type, browser type, screen resolution, browser language, internet protocol (IP) address, unique identifier, general location such as city, state or geographic area, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Site or Services.  How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Site and Services.

**Cookies.**  We may log information using “cookies.”  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  Other similar tools we may use to collect information by automated means include web server logs, web beacons and pixel tags.  This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your interests and needs.

Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

Hotjar is a full-session replay product that helps us see clearly what actions our Site visitors take and where they might get stuck or confused.  Hotjar’s service allows us to record and replay an individual’s interaction with the Site and the Services.  This helps us to understand our customer’s experience, where they might get stuck, and how we can improve the Site and the Services.  You can review Hotjar’s privacy policy by visiting https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy/.
