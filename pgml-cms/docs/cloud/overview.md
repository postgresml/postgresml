# PostgresML Cloud 

PostgresML Cloud is the best place to perform in-database ML/AI. 

It’s a fully managed version of our popular open-source extension that combines the robustness of PostgreSQL with specialized AI capabilities and hardware (GPUs). PostgresML Cloud provides the infrastructure and compute engine for users to deliver state-of-the-art AI-driven applications – without the headache of managing a database or GPUs. 

You’ll have access to a powerful suite of production-ready ML/AI capabilities from day one, while PostgresML Cloud takes care of all the performance, scalability, security, and reliability requirements typical of database and hardware management. An added bonus is that the PostgresML Cloud approach to GPU management is inherently more cost-effective than purchasing them yourself.

## PostgresML Cloud Plans

PostgresML Cloud offers three configurations to suit various project needs and organizational sizes,  from small teams just starting with AI integration to large enterprises requiring advanced features and dedicated support.

PostgresML Cloud is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure Cloud, world-wide.
