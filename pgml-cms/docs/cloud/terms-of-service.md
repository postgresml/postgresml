# Terms of Service

Last Updated: 7/16/2024

## Introduction

Welcome to PostgresML! Your use of PostgresML’s services, including the services PostgresML makes available through this website and applications which link to these terms of service (the “Site”) and to all software or services offered by PostgresML in connection with any of those (the “Services”), is governed by these terms of service (the “Terms”), so please carefully read them before using the Services.  For the purposes of these Terms, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “PostgresML” refer to Hyperparam Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.

In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “Customer” will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.

You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by PostgresML or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

If you have entered into a separate written agreement with PostgresML for use of the Services, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in these Terms with respect to the Services specified in such agreement.

Arbitration notice: except for certain types of disputes described in the arbitration clause below, you agree that disputes between you and PostgresML will be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration and you waive any right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

By using, downloading, installing, or otherwise accessing the services or any materials included in or with the services, you hereby agree to be bound by these terms.  If you do not accept these terms, then you may not use, download, install, or otherwise access the services.

Certain features of the services or site may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the service or site in connection with such features. To the extent such terms, guidelines, and rules conflict with these terms, such terms shall govern solely with respect to such features.  In all other situations, these terms shall govern.

## Your Account

In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide PostgresML with certain information, including your name, contact information, username and password (“Credentials”). PostgresML handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not PostgresML, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. If your contact information or other information relating to your account changes, you must notify PostgresML promptly and keep such information current. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify PostgresML of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify PostgresML immediately.

## Content

A variety of information, reviews, recommendations, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, and other materials (“Content”) may be made available through the Services by PostgresML or its suppliers (“PostgresML-Supplied Content”). While PostgresML strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, PostgresML cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any PostgresML-Supplied Content.

You acknowledge that you may also be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services. All such information is referred to below as “User Content.”

You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that PostgresML has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which PostgresML may suffer) in connection with such User Content.  If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services.  Furthermore, you acknowledge that PostgresML does not control or actively monitor Content uploaded by users and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will PostgresML be liable in any way for any such Content.

PostgresML may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. PostgresML may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, PostgresML may also delete the User Content as of that date.  User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.  You agree that PostgresML has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services.

PostgresML reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor and remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from PostgresML. PostgresML also reserves the right to directly take down such Content.

THE LIMITATIONS ON POSTGRESML’S LIABILITY TO YOU IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT POSTGRESML HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL POSTGRESML’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SERVICES IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

You agree to hold harmless and indemnify PostgresML, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners (collectively “PostgresML and Partners”) from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to (a) your breach of the Terms, (b) your use of the Services, (c) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Services, or (d) your User Content, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, of every kind and nature.

You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products.

Further, you warrant that your feedback is not subject to any license terms that would purport to require us to comply with any additional obligations with respect to any products or services that incorporate any of your feedback.

## Disputes

**Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with PostgresML and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.**

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except for small claims disputes in which you or PostgresML seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or claims for injunctive relief by either party, any dispute or controversy arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-307) and the then current rules of JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services) by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with such rules. Where arbitration is not required by these Terms, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.  ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SALES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND POSTGRESML, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTION PROCEDURES SHALL NOT BE ASSERTED IN NOR APPLY TO ANY ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO BRING ANY LEGAL ACTION, BASED UPON ANY LEGAL THEORY INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST POSTGRESML THAT IS MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE APPLICABLE ORDER.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by emailing us at contact@postgresml.org. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.

## Miscellaneous

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Services and all related activities. These Terms shall not be modified except in writing signed by both parties or by a new posting of these Terms issued by us. If any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part shall be deemed severed and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The failure of PostgresML to exercise or enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any right or provision by PostgresML must be in writing and shall only apply to the specific instance identified in such writing. You may not assign these Terms, or any rights or licenses granted hereunder, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise without our prior written consent.

You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.
