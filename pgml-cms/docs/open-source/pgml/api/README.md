# PGML API

The API docs provides a brief overview of the available functions exposed by `pgml`.

<!-- For more in depth guides on sepcific features see the [Guides section](). -->

<!-- For example applications see our [Example apps section](). -->

| Function | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [pgml.embed()](pgml.embed) | Generate embeddings using the latest sentence transformers from Hugging Face. |
| [pgml.transform()](pgml.transform) | Text generation using LLMs like Llama, Mixtral, and many more, with models downloaded from Hugging Face. |
| [pgml.transform_stream()](pgml.transform_stream) | Streaming version of [pgml.transform()](pgml.transform), which fetches partial responses as they are being generated by the model, substantially decreasing time to first token. |
| [pgml.tune()](pgml.tune) | Perform fine tuning tasks on Hugging Face models, using data stored in the database. | 
| [pgml.train()](pgml.train) | Train a model on PostgreSQL tables or views using any algorithm from Scikit-learn, with the additional support for XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost. |
| [pgml.predict()](pgml.predict/) | Run inference on live application data using a model trained with [pgml.train()](pgml.train). |
| [pgml.deploy()](pgml.deploy) | Deploy a specific version of a model trained with pgml.train(), using your own accuracy metrics. |
| [pgml.load_dataset()](pgml.load_dataset) | Load any of the toy datasets from Scikit-learn or any dataset from Hugging Face. |
| [pgml.decompose()](pgml.decompose) | Reduces the number of dimensions in a vector via matrix decomposition. |
| [pgml.chunk()](pgml.chunk) | Break large bodies of text into smaller pieces via commonly used splitters. |
| [pgml.generate()](pgml.generate) | Perform inference with custom models. |
