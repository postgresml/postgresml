# Serverless databases

A Serverless PostgresML database can be created in less than 5 seconds and provides immediate access to modern GPU acceleration, a predefined set of state-of-the-art large language models that should satisfy most use cases, and dozens of supervised learning algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost, and everything from Scikit-learn.
With a Serverless database, storage and compute resources dynamically adapt to your application's needs, ensuring it can scale down or handle peak loads without overprovisioning.

Serverless databases are billed on a pay-per-use basis and we offer $100 in free credits to get you started!
