## Select a plan <a href="#create-a-new-account" id="create-a-new-account"></a>

Choose the type of GPU powered database deployment that is right for you.

* **Serverless** is the easiest way to get started. We offer a generous free tier with GPU access and 5GB of data storage.
* **Dedicated** offers additional configuration options for more advanced use cases with established workloads and more predictable usage patterns.

Click on **Get Started** under the plan of your choice.

## Your database credentials  <a href="#create-a-new-account" id="create-a-new-account"></a>

We'll automatically provision an initial set of database credentials and provide you with the connection string. You can connect to your database if you have `psql` installed on your machine, or any other PostgreSQL client.
