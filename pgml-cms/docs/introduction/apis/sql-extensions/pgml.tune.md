# pgml.tune()

## Fine Tuning

Pre-trained models allow you to get up and running quickly, but you can likely improve performance on your dataset by fine tuning them. Normally, you'll bring your own data to the party, but for these examples we'll use datasets published on Hugging Face.&#x20;

### Translation Example

The [Helsinki-NLP](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP) organization provides more than a thousand pre-trained models to translate between different language pairs. These can be further fine tuned on additional datasets with domain specific vocabulary. Researchers have also created large collections of documents that have been manually translated across languages by experts for training data.

#### Prepare the data

The [kde4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kde4) dataset contains many language pairs. Subsets can be loaded into your Postgres instance with a call to `pgml.load_dataset`, or you may wish to create your own fine tuning dataset with vocabulary specific to your domain.

```sql
SELECT pgml.load_dataset('kde4', kwargs => '{"lang1": "en", "lang2": "es"}');
```

You can view the newly loaded data in your Postgres database:

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgml.kde4 LIMIT 5;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
id  |

```

\===

This HuggingFace dataset stores the data as language key pairs in a JSON document. To use it with PostgresML, we'll need to provide a `VIEW` that structures the data into more primitively typed columns.

\=== "SQL"

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW kde4_en_to_es AS
SELECT translation->>'en' AS "en", translation->>'es' AS "es"
FROM pgml.kde4
LIMIT 10;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
CREATE VIEW
```

\===

Now, we can see the data in more normalized form. The exact column names don't matter for now, we'll specify which one is the target during the training call, and the other one will be used as the input.

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT * FROM kde4_en_to_es LIMIT 10;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
                                            en                                            |                                                   es

#### Tune the model

Tuning is very similar to training with PostgresML, although we specify a `model_name` to download from Hugging Face instead of the base `algorithm`.

```sql
SELECT pgml.tune(
    'Translate English to Spanish',
    task => 'translation',
    relation_name => 'kde4_en_to_es',
    y_column_name => 'es', -- translate into spanish
    model_name => 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es',
    hyperparams => '{
        "learning_rate": 2e-5,
        "per_device_train_batch_size": 16,
        "per_device_eval_batch_size": 16,
        "num_train_epochs": 1,
        "weight_decay": 0.01,
        "max_length": 128
    }',
    test_size => 0.5,
    test_sampling => 'last'
);
```

#### Generate Translations

!!! note

Translations use the `pgml.generate` API since they return `TEXT` rather than numeric values. You may also call `pgml.generate` with a `TEXT[]` for batch processing.

\=== "SQL"

```sql

SELECT pgml.generate('Translate English to Spanish', 'I love SQL')
AS spanish;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
    spanish

### Text Classification Example

DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model based on the BERT architecture. It can be fine tuned on specific datasets to learn further nuance between positive and negative examples. For this example, we'll fine tune `distilbert-base-uncased` on the IMBD dataset, which is a list of movie reviews along with a positive or negative label.

Without tuning, DistilBERT classifies every single movie review as `positive`, and has a F1 score of 0.367, which is about what you'd expect for a relatively useless classifier. However, after training for a single epoch (takes about 10 minutes on an Nvidia 1080 TI), the F1 jumps to 0.928 which is a huge improvement, indicating DistilBERT can now fairly accurately predict sentiment from IMDB reviews. Further training for another epoch only results in a very minor improvement to 0.931, and the 3rd epoch is flat, also at 0.931 which indicates DistilBERT is unlikely to continue learning more about this particular dataset with additional training. You can view the results of each model, like those trained from scratch, in the dashboard.

Once our model has been fine tuned on the dataset, it'll be saved and deployed with a Project visible in the Dashboard, just like models built from simpler algorithms.

[![Fine Tuning](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/raw/v2.7.12/dashboard/static/images/dashboard/tuning.png)](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/blob/v2.7.12/dashboard/static/images/dashboard/tuning.png)

#### Prepare the data

The IMDB dataset has 50,000 examples of user reviews with positive or negative viewing experiences as the labels, and is split 50/50 into training and evaluation datasets.

```sql
SELECT pgml.load_dataset('imdb');
```

You can view the newly loaded data in your Postgres database:

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgml.imdb LIMIT 1;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
                                                                                                                                                            text                                                                                                                                           | label

#### Tune the model

Tuning has a nearly identical API to training, except you may pass the name of a [model published on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) to start with, rather than training an algorithm from scratch.

```sql
SELECT pgml.tune(
    'IMDB Review Sentiment',
    task => 'text-classification',
    relation_name => 'pgml.imdb',
    y_column_name => 'label',
    model_name => 'distilbert-base-uncased',
    hyperparams => '{
        "learning_rate": 2e-5,
        "per_device_train_batch_size": 16,
        "per_device_eval_batch_size": 16,
        "num_train_epochs": 1,
        "weight_decay": 0.01
    }',
    test_size => 0.5,
    test_sampling => 'last'
);
```

#### Make predictions

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT pgml.predict('IMDB Review Sentiment', 'I love SQL')
AS sentiment;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
sentiment
-----------
1
(1 row)

Time: 16.681 ms
```

\===

The default for predict in a classification problem classifies the statement as one of the labels. In this case, 0 is negative and 1 is positive. If you'd like to check the individual probabilities associated with each class you can use the `predict_proba` API:

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT pgml.predict_proba('IMDB Review Sentiment', 'I love SQL')
AS sentiment;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
                sentiment
-------------------------------------------
[0.06266672909259796, 0.9373332858085632]
(1 row)

Time: 18.101 ms
```

\===

This shows that there is a 6.26% chance for category 0 (negative sentiment), and a 93.73% chance it's category 1 (positive sentiment).

See the [task documentation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification) for more examples, use cases, models and datasets.

### Summarization Example

At a high level, summarization uses similar techniques to translation. Both use an input sequence to generate an output sequence. The difference being that summarization extracts the most relevant parts of the input sequence to generate the output.

#### Prepare the data

[BillSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/billsum) is a dataset with training examples that summarize US Congressional and California state bills. You can pass `kwargs` specific to loading datasets, in this case we'll restrict the dataset to California samples:

```sql
SELECT pgml.load_dataset('billsum', kwargs => '{"split": "ca_test"}');
```

You can view the newly loaded data in your Postgres database:

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgml.billsum LIMIT 1;
```

\=== "Result"

```

(a) (1) Since 1899 congressionally chartered veterans’ organizations have provided a valuable service to our nation’s returning service members. These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(2) These veterans’ organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

(f) In a 1994 memorandum, the State Board of Equalization’s legal division further concluded that the areas normally considered eligible for exemptions are the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans’ records, but that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charitable purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(g) Tax-exempt status is intended to provide economic incentive and support to veterans’ organizations to provide for the social welfare of the community of current and former military personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(h) The State Board of Equalization’s constriction of the tax exemption has resulted in an onerous tax burden on California veteran service organizations posts or halls, hinders the posts’ ability to provide facilities for veterans, and threatens the economic viability of many local organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(i) The charitable activities of a veteran service organizations post or hall are much more than the counseling of veterans. The requirements listed for qualification for the federal tax exemption clearly dictate a need for more than just an office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(j) Programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

(A) The exempt activities of a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans’ organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.                                                                        +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization’s exempt purposes and activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. The portion of the property ineligible for the veterans’ organization exemption shall be that area used primarily to prepare and serve alcoholic beverages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
(e) An organization that files a claim for the exemption provided for in this section shall file with the assessor a valid organizational clearance certificate issued pursuant to Section 254.6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        +|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

                                                                                                                                                                                    |

\===

This dataset has 3 fields, but summarization transformers only take a single input to produce their output. We can create a view that simply omits the `title` from the training data:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW billsum_training_data
AS SELECT "text", summary FROM pgml.billsum;
```

Or, it might be interesting to concat the title to the text field to see how relevant it actually is to the bill. If the title of a bill is the first sentence, and doesn't appear in summary, it may indicate that it's a poorly chosen title for the bill:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW billsum_training_data
AS SELECT title || '\n' || "text" AS "text", summary FROM pgml.billsum 
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Tune the model

Tuning has a nearly identical API to training, except you may pass the name of a [model published on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) to start with, rather than training an algorithm from scratch.

```sql
SELECT pgml.tune(
    'Legal Summarization',
    task => 'summarization',
    relation_name => 'billsum_training_data',
    y_column_name => 'summary',
    model_name => 'sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-1',
    hyperparams => '{
        "learning_rate": 2e-5,
        "per_device_train_batch_size": 2,
        "per_device_eval_batch_size": 2,
        "num_train_epochs": 1,
        "weight_decay": 0.01,
        "max_length": 1024
    }',
    test_size => 0.2,
    test_sampling => 'last'
);
```

#### Make predictions

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT pgml.predict('IMDB Review Sentiment', 'I love SQL') AS sentiment;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
sentiment
-----------
1
(1 row)

Time: 16.681 ms
```

\===

The default for predict in a classification problem classifies the statement as one of the labels. In this case 0 is negative and 1 is positive. If you'd like to check the individual probabilities associated with each class you can use the `predict_proba` API

\=== "SQL"

```sql
SELECT pgml.predict_proba('IMDB Review Sentiment', 'I love SQL') AS sentiment;
```

\=== "Result"

```sql
                sentiment
-------------------------------------------
[0.06266672909259796, 0.9373332858085632]
(1 row)

Time: 18.101 ms
```

\===

This shows that there is a 6.26% chance for category 0 (negative sentiment), and a 93.73% chance it's category 1 (positive sentiment).

### Text Generation

```sql
SELECT pgml.load_dataset('bookcorpus', "limit" => 100);

SELECT pgml.tune(
    'GPT Generator',
    task => 'text-generation',
    relation_name => 'pgml.bookcorpus',
    y_column_name => 'text',
    model_name => 'gpt2',
    hyperparams => '{
        "learning_rate": 2e-5,
        "num_train_epochs": 1
    }',
    test_size => 0.2,
    test_sampling => 'last'
);

SELECT pgml.generate('GPT Generator', 'While I wandered weak and weary');
```
