# pgml.predict()

## API

The `pgml.predict()` function is the key value proposition of PostgresML. It provides online predictions using the best, automatically deployed model for a project. The API for predictions is very simple and only requires two arguments: the project name and the features used for prediction.

```sql
select pgml.predict (
    project_name TEXT,
    features REAL[]
)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter      | Example                         | Description                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_name` | `'My First PostgresML Project'` | The project name used to train models in `pgml.train()`. |
| `features`     | `ARRAY[0.1, 0.45, 1.0]`         | The feature vector used to predict a novel data point.   |

### Regression Example

```sql
SELECT pgml.predict(
    'My Classification Project', 
    ARRAY[0.1, 2.0, 5.0]
) AS prediction;
```

where `ARRAY[0.1, 2.0, 5.0]` is the same type of features used in training, in the same order as in the training data table or view. This score can be used in other regular queries.

!!! example

```sql
SELECT *,
    pgml.predict(
        'Buy it Again',
        ARRAY[
            user.location_id,
            NOW() - user.created_at,
            user.total_purchases_in_dollars
        ]
    ) AS buying_score
FROM users
WHERE tenant_id = 5
ORDER BY buying_score
LIMIT 25;
```

!!!

### Classification Example

If you've already been through the [pgml.train](../pgml.train/ "mention") examples, you can see the predictive results of those models:

```sql
SELECT
    target,
    pgml.predict('Handwritten Digit Image Classifier', image) AS prediction
FROM pgml.digits 
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
 target | prediction
--------+------------
      0 |          0
      1 |          1
      2 |          2
      3 |          3
      4 |          4
      5 |          5
      6 |          6
      7 |          7
      8 |          8
      9 |          9
(10 rows)
```

### Active Model

Since it's so easy to train multiple algorithms with different hyperparameters, sometimes it's a good idea to know which deployed model is used to make predictions. You can find that out by querying the `pgml.deployed_models` view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgml.deployed_models;
```

```sql
 id |                name                |      task      | algorithm | runtime |        deployed_at
----+------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------+----------------------------
  4 | Handwritten Digit Image Classifier | classification | xgboost   | rust    | 2022-10-11 13:06:26.473489
(1 row)
```

PostgresML will automatically deploy a model only if it has better metrics than existing ones, so it's safe to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters.

Take a look at [pgml.deploy.md](../pgml.deploy.md "mention") for more details.

### Specific Models

You may also specify a model\_id to predict rather than a project name, to use a particular training run. You can find model ids by querying the `pgml.models` table.

```sql
SELECT models.id, models.algorithm, models.metrics
FROM pgml.models
JOIN pgml.projects 
  ON projects.id = models.project_id
WHERE projects.name = 'Handwritten Digit Image Classifier';
```

```sql
 id | algorithm |                                                                                                         metrics

----+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------

```

For example, making predictions with `model_id = 1`:

```sql
SELECT
    target,
    pgml.predict(1, image) AS prediction
FROM pgml.digits 
LIMIT 10;
```

```plsql
 target | prediction
--------+------------
      0 |          0
      1 |          1
      2 |          2
      3 |          3
      4 |          4
      5 |          5
      6 |          6
      7 |          7
      8 |          8
      9 |          9
(10 rows)
```
