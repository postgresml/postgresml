# Rag Timing Tests

This script runs timing tests for common rag systems.

To run it copy `.env.deveopment` to `.env` and make sure to set the appropriate variables in the `.env` file, install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run `python3 __main__.py`.

Notice that this script assumes certain actions to create databases or setup "collections" have been performed for each cloud provider. See the script for more details.
