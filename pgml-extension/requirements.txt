# If you update this file, `pip freeze` the full locked requirements as well to prevent
# future dependency incompatibility on all supported platforms. We'd use Poetry or some
# other sane lockfile resolution mechanism other than pip, except we have to maintain
# this isn't really a Python project, so Poetry conventions don't work, and we need
# different dependencies on platforms that have different hardware acceleration.

# Only the immediate dependencies of PostgresML are maintained here.
# See requirements.linux.txt or requirements.macos.txt for complete and locked versions.

# Python 3.12 can't currently resolve all dependencies:
# catboost fails to build
# virtualenv -p python3.11 pgml-venv

# These packages are specifically locked to avoid known bugs
