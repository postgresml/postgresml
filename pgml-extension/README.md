# PostgresML Extension

PostgresML is a PostgreSQL extension providing end-to-end machine learning inside your database. The extension is primarily written in Rust using [pgx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgx) and provides a SQL interface to various machine learning algorithm implementations such as [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), and [other classical methods](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa).

Python seems to be the de facto ML industry standard, so we also include "reference" implementations of classical algorithms from Scikit-learn as well for comparison to the Rust implementations, but runtime performance and correctness. The Python integration is written using `pyo3`.

See [our blog](https://postgresml.org/blog/postgresml-is-moving-to-rust-for-our-2.0-release/) for a performance comparison and further motivations.

## Requirements

PostgresML requires Python 3.7 or above and the Rust compiler and toolchain. You can download the Rust compiler [here](https://rust-lang.org).

We develop and test this extension on Linux, OS X, and Windows using WSL2.

## Dependencies

If you haven't already, install:

- `cmake`
- `libclang-dev`
- `libopenblas-dev`
- `build-essential`
- `libssl-dev`
- `openssl-sys`
- `pkg-config`
- `libreadline-dev`
- `libpython3-dev` (Python 3.7 or higher)

## Python

If your system comes with Python 3.6 or lower, you'll need to install `libpython3.7-dev` or higher. You can get it from [`ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa):

1. `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
2. `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libpython3.7-dev`


## Update postgresql.conf

PostgresML requires to be loaded as a shared library. For local development, this is in `~/.pgx/data-13/postgresql.conf`:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pgml'     # (change requires restart)
```

## Local development

0. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. `cargo install cargo-pgx --version=0.5.6` version needs to match Cargo.toml
2. `cargo pgx init` (this will take a while, go get a coffee)
3. `cargo pgx run`
4. `DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pgml; DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS pgml CASCADE;`
5. `CREATE EXTENSION pgml;`
6. `SELECT * FROM pgml.load_dataset('diabetes');`
7. `SELECT * FROM pgml.train('Project name', 'regression', 'pgml.diabetes', 'target', 'xgboost');`
8. `SELECT target, pgml.predict('Project name', ARRAY[age, sex, bmi, bp, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6]) FROM pgml.diabetes LIMIT 10;`

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```commandline
cargo test
```

Run integration tests:
```commandline
cargo pgx run --release
psql -h localhost -p 28813 -d pgml -f tests/test.sql -P pager
```

## Packaging

This requires Docker. Once Docker is installed, you can run:

```bash
bash build_extension.sh
```

which will produce a `.deb` file in the current directory (this will take about 20 minutes). The deb file can be installed with `apt-get`, for example:

```bash
apt-get install ./postgresql-pgml-12_0.0.4-ubuntu20.04-amd64.deb
```

which will take care of installing its dependencies as well. Make sure to run this as root and not with sudo.
