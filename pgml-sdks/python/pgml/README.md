## Overview
The Python SDK is designed to facilitate the development of scalable vector search applications on PostgreSQL databases. With this SDK, you can seamlessly manage various database tables related to documents, text chunks, text splitters, LLM (Language Model) models, and embeddings. By leveraging the SDK's capabilities, you can efficiently index LLM embeddings using PgVector for fast and accurate queries.

### Key Features

- **Automated Database Management**: With the SDK, you can easily handle the management of database tables related to documents, text chunks, text splitters, LLM models, and embeddings. This automated management system simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining your vector search application's data structure.


- **Embedding Generation from Open Source Models**: The Python SDK provides the ability to generate embeddings using hundreds of open source models. These models, trained on vast amounts of data, capture the semantic meaning of text and enable powerful analysis and search capabilities.

- **Flexible and Scalable Vector Search**: The Python SDK empowers you to build flexible and scalable vector search applications. The Python SDK seamlessly integrates with PgVector, a PostgreSQL extension specifically designed for handling vector-based indexing and querying. By leveraging these indices, you can perform advanced searches, rank results by relevance, and retrieve accurate and meaningful information from your database.

### Use Cases

Embeddings, the core concept of the Python SDK, find applications in various scenarios, including:

- Search: Embeddings are commonly used for search functionalities, where results are ranked by relevance to a query string. By comparing the embeddings of query strings and documents, you can retrieve search results in order of their similarity or relevance.

- Clustering: With embeddings, you can group text strings by similarity, enabling clustering of related data. By measuring the similarity between embeddings, you can identify clusters or groups of text strings that share common characteristics.

- Recommendations: Embeddings play a crucial role in recommendation systems. By identifying items with related text strings based on their embeddings, you can provide personalized recommendations to users.

- Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection involves identifying outliers or anomalies that have little relatedness to the rest of the data. Embeddings can aid in this process by quantifying the similarity between text strings and flagging outliers.

- Classification: Embeddings are utilized in classification tasks, where text strings are classified based on their most similar label. By comparing the embeddings of text strings and labels, you can classify new text strings into predefined categories.

### How the Python SDK Works
The Python SDK streamlines the development of vector search applications by abstracting away the complexities of database management and indexing. Here's an overview of how the SDK works:

- **Document and Text Chunk Management**: The SDK provides a convenient interface to create, update, and delete documents and their corresponding text chunks. You can easily organize and structure your text data within the PostgreSQL database.

- **Open Source Model Integration**: With the SDK, you can seamlessly incorporate a wide range of open source models to generate high-quality embeddings. These models capture the semantic meaning of text and enable powerful analysis and search capabilities.

- **Embedding Indexing**: The Python SDK utilizes the PgVector extension to efficiently index the embeddings generated by the open source models. This indexing process optimizes search performance and allows for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant results.

- **Querying and Search**: Once the embeddings are indexed, you can perform vector-based searches on the documents and text chunks stored in the PostgreSQL database. The SDK provides intuitive methods for executing queries and retrieving search results.

## Quickstart
Follow the steps below to quickly get started with the Python SDK for building scalable vector search applications on PostgresML databases.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **PostgresML Database**: Ensure you have a PostgresML database version >`2.3.1`. You can spin up a database using [Docker](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml#installation) or [sign up for a free GPU-powered database](https://postgresml.org/signup). Set the `PGML_CONNECTION` environment variable to the connection string of your PostgresML database. If not set, the SDK will use the default connection string for your local installation `postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/pgml_development`.

### Installation

To install the Python SDK, use pip:

```
pip install pgml
```

### Sample Code

Once you have the Python SDK installed, you can use the following sample code as a starting point for your vector search application:

```python
from pgml import Database
import os
import json
from datasets import load_dataset
from time import time
from rich import print as rprint

local_pgml = "postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/pgml_development"

conninfo = os.environ.get("PGML_CONNECTION", local_pgml)
db = Database(conninfo)

collection_name = "test_pgml_sdk_1"
collection = db.create_or_get_collection(collection_name)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code imports the necessary modules and packages, including pgml.Database, os, json, datasets, time, and rich.print.
- It defines the local_pgml variable with the default local connection string, and retrieves the connection information from the PGML_CONNECTION environment variable or uses the default if not set.
- An instance of the Database class is created by passing the connection information.

```python
data = load_dataset("squad", split="train")
data = data.to_pandas()
data = data.drop_duplicates(subset=["context"])

documents = [
    {'id': r['id'], "text": r["context"], "title": r["title"]}
    for r in data.to_dict(orient="records")
]

collection.upsert_documents(documents[:200])
collection.generate_chunks()
collection.generate_embeddings()
```

**Explanation:**

- The code loads the "squad" dataset, converts it to a pandas DataFrame, and drops any duplicate context values.
- It creates a list of dictionaries representing the documents to be indexed, with each dictionary containing the document's ID, text, and title.
- The `upsert_documents` method is called to insert or update the first 200 documents in the collection.
- The `generate_chunks` method splits the documents into smaller text chunks for efficient indexing and search.
- The `generate_embeddings` method generates embeddings for the documents in the collection.

```python
start = time()
results = collection.vector_search("Who won 20 grammy awards?", top_k=2)
rprint(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
rprint("Query time: %0.3f seconds" % (time() - start))
db.archive_collection(collection_name)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code initializes a timer using `time()` to measure the query time.
- The `vector_search` method is called to perform a vector-based search on the collection. The query string is "Who won 20 grammy awards?", and the top 2 results are requested.
- The search results are printed using `rprint` and formatted as JSON with indentation.
- The query time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the current time.
- Finally, the `archive_collection` method is called to archive the collection and free up resources in the PostgresML database.

**Running the Code**

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

Execute the following command:

```
python vector_search.py
```
You should see the search results and the query time printed in the terminal. As you can see, our vector search engine found the right text chunk with the answer we are looking for.
