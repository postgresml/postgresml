# PgCat

PgCat is PostgreSQL connection pooler and proxy which scales PostgresML deployments. It supports read/write query separation, multiple replicas, automatic traffic distribution and load balancing, sharding, and many more features expected out of high availability enterprise grade Postgres databases.

Written in Rust and powered by Tokio, it takes advantage of multiple CPUs, and the safety and performance guarantees of the Rust language.

PgCat, like PostgresML, is free and open source, distributed under the MIT license. It's currently running in our Cloud, powering both Serverless and Dedicated databases.
