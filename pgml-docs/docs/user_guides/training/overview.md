# Training

The training function is at the heart of PostgresML. It's a powerful single call that can handle the different tasks of training depending on the arguments passed.

## API
Most parameters are optional other than the `project_name` which is a simple human readable identifier to organize your work. 

```sql linenums="1" title="pgml.train"
 pgml.train(
	project_name TEXT,                       -- Human-friendly project name
	task TEXT DEFAULT NULL,                  -- 'regression' or 'classification'
	relation_name TEXT DEFAULT NULL,         -- name of table or view
	y_column_name TEXT DEFAULT NULL,         -- aka "label" or "unknown" or "target"
	algorithm TEXT DEFAULT 'linear',         -- statistical learning method
	hyperparams JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,   -- options for the model
	search TEXT DEFAULT NULL,                -- hyperparam tuning, 'grid' or 'random'
	search_params JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB, -- hyperparam search space
	search_args JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,   -- hyperparam options
	test_size REAL DEFAULT 0.25,             -- fraction of the data for the test set
	test_sampling TEXT DEFAULT 'random'      -- 'random', 'first' or 'last'  
)
```

!!! example
    A minimal first call for a project looks like:

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM pgml.train(
        'My Classification Project', 
        'classification', 
        'my_table_name', 
        'my_tables_target_column_name'
    );
    ```

The `train` function requires an `task` the first time a `project_name` is used. That task is either `regression` or `classification`, which determines the relevant metrics and analysis performed for models trained toward a common goal. It also requires a `relation_name` and `y_column_name` that will be used to establish the first `Snapshot` of training and test data. By default, 25% of the data (specified by `test_size`) will be randomly sampled to measure the performance of the model after the `algorithm` has been fit to the rest. 

!!! tip
    Postgres supports named arguments for function calls, which allows you to pass only the arguments you need.

    ```SQL
        pgml.train('Project Name', algorithm => 'xgboost')
    ```

Future calls to `train` may restate the same `task` for a project, or omit it, but can't change it. Projects manage their active model using the metrics relevant to a particular task, so changing it would mean some models in the project are no longer directly comparable. In that case, it's better to start a new project.

!!! note
    If you'd like to train multiple models on the same `Snapshot`, follow up calls to `train` may omit the `relation_name`, `y_column_name`, `test_size` and `test_sampling` arguments to reuse identical data with multiple algorithms or hyperparams. The `Snapshot` is also saved after training runs for any follow up analysis required.



## Getting training data
A large part of machine learning is acquiring, cleaning and preparing data for algorithms. Naturally, we think Postgres is a great place to store your data. For the purpose of this example, we'll load a toy dataset, a classic handwritten digits image collection from scikit-learn.

=== "SQL"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    pgml_development=# SELECT pgml.load_dataset('digits');
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    NOTICE:  table "digits" does not exist, skipping -- (1)
    load_dataset
    --------------
    OK
    (1 row)
    ```

    1. This NOTICE can safely be ignored. PostgresML attempts to do a clean reload by dropping the `pgml.digits` table if it exists. The first time this command is run, the table does not exist.


PostgresML loads this into a fixed table `pgml.digits`. You can examine the 2D arrays of image data, as well as the label in the `target` column.

=== "SQL"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    pgml_development=# SELECT target, image FROM pgml.digits LIMIT 5;
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    target |                                                                                image

    (5 rows)
    ```

## Training the model
Now that we've got data, we're ready to train a model using an algorithm. We'll start with the default `linear` algorithm to demonstrate the basics. See the [Algorithms](/user_guides/training/algorithm_selection/) reference for a complete list of available choices.

=== "SQL"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    SELECT * FROM pgml.train('Handwritten Digit Image Classifier', 'classification', 'pgml.digits', 'target');
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```sql linenums="1"
                project_name            |     task       | algorithm |  status
    ------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------
     Handwritten Digit Image Classifier | classification | linear    | deployed
    (1 row)
    ```

The output gives us information about the training run, including the `deployed` status. This is great news indicating training has successfully reached a new high score for the project's key metric and our new model was automatically deployed as the one that will be used to make new predictions for the project. See [Deployments](/user_guides/predictions/deployments/) for a guide to managing the active model.

## Inspecting the results
Now we can inspect some of the artifacts a training run creates. 

=== "SQL"

    ```sql linenums="1"
    SELECT * FROM pgml.overview;
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```sql linenums="1"
                    name                |        deployed_at         |     task       | algorithm | relation_name | y_column_name | test_sampling | test_size
    ------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------

    (1 row)
    ```
