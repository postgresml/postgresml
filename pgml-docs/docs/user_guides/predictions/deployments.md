# Deployments

Models are automatically deployed if their key metric (__R__<sup>2</sup> for regression, __F__<sub>1</sub> for classification) is improved over the currently deployed version during training. If you want to manage deploys manually, you can always change which model is currently responsible for making predictions.


## API

```sql linenums="1" title="pgml.deploy"
pgml.deploy(
	project_name TEXT,                  -- Human-friendly project name
	strategy TEXT DEFAULT 'best_score', -- 'rollback', 'best_score', or 'most_recent'
	algorithm TEXT DEFAULT NULL    -- filter candidates to a particular algorithm, NULL = all qualify
)
```

The default behavior allows any algorithm to qualify, but deployment candidates can be further restricted to a specific algorithm by passing the `algorithm`.

!!! note 
    Deployed models are cached at the session level to improve prediction times. Active sessions will not see deploys until they reconnect. 

=== "SQL"

	```sql linenums="1"
	SELECT * FROM pgml.deploy('Handwritten Digit Image Classifier', 'best_score');
	```

=== "Output"

	```sql linenums="1"
                project_name            |    strategy    | algorithm
	------------------------------------+----------------+----------------
	 Handwritten Digit Image Classifier | classification | linear
	(1 row)
	```


## Strategies
There are 3 different deployment strategies available

strategy | description
--- | ---
most_recent | The most recently trained model for this project
best_score | The model that achieved the best key metric score
rollback | The model that was previously deployed for this project


## Rolling back to a specific algorithm
Rolling back creates a new deploy for the model that was deployed before the current one. Multiple rollbacks in a row will effectively oscilate between the two most recently deployed models, making rollbacks a relatively safe operation. 

=== "SQL"

	```sql linenums="1"
	SELECT * FROM pgml.deploy('Handwritten Digit Image Classifier', 'rollback', 'svm');
	```

=== "Output"

	```sql linenums="1"
                project_name            |    strategy    | algorithm
	------------------------------------+----------------+----------------
	 Handwritten Digit Image Classifier | classification | linear
	(1 row)
	```
