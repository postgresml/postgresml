# Welcome to the PostgresML documentation project

PostgresML documentation is created with https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/. There is excellent documentation there for how to get the most out of markdown.

A local documentation server will automatically be started by docker-compose, but to see live updates run it without docker:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ mkdocs serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:8001/ to see the docs. (The development endpoint
is configured with `dev_addr` in `mkdocs.yaml`.)
