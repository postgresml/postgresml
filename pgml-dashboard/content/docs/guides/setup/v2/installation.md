# Installation

The PostgresML deployment consists of two parts: the Postgres extension and the dashboard app. The extension provides all the machine learning functionality and can be used independently. The dashboard app provides a system overview for easier management and notebooks for writing experiments.

## Extension

The extension can be installed from our Ubuntu `apt` repository or, if you're using a different distribution, from source.

### Dependencies

#### Python 3.7+

PostgresML 2.0 distributed through `apt` requires Python 3.7 or higher. We use Python to provide backwards compatibility with Scikit, and for Hugging Face transformers.

=== "Ubuntu"

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-virtualenv python3-dev
```

=== "macOS"

```
brew install python@3.11 virtualenv
```

===

#### Packages

We use many Python packages to provide access to Hugging Face transformers and Scikit-learn models. We recommend you use a virtual environment
to install them, but you can also install them into system directories by using `sudo`.

=== "Virtual environment (recommended)"

```bash
virtualenv postgresml-venv && \
source postgresml-venv && \
pip install -r pgml-extension/requirements.txt
```

=== "System"

```bash
sudo pip3 install -r pgml-extension/requirements.txt
```

===


#### Python 3.6 and below

If your system Python is older, consider installing a newer version from [`ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) or Homebrew. If you don't want to or can't have Python 3.7 or higher on your system, refer to **From Source (Debian)** below for building without Python support.


#### PostgreSQL

PostgresML is a Postgres extension and requires PostgreSQL to be installed. We support PostgreSQL 11 through 15.


=== "Ubuntu"

You can use the PostgreSQL version that comes with your system or get it from the [PostgreSQL PPA](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install postgresql
```

=== "macOS"

```bash
brew install postgresql@15
```

===

### Install the extension

=== "Ubuntu"

1. Add our repository into your sources:

    ``` bash
    echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.postgresml.org $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
    sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    ```
2. Install the extension:

    ``` bash
    export POSTGRES_VERSION=15
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-pgml-${POSTGRES_VERSION}
    ```

Both ARM and Intel/AMD architectures are supported.


=== "From Source (Debian)"

These instructions assume a Debian flavor Linux and PostgreSQL 15. Adjust the PostgreSQL
version accordingly if yours is different. Other flavors of Linux should work, but have not been tested. PostgreSQL 11 through 15 are supported.

1. Install the latest Rust compiler from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

2. Install a [modern version](https://apt.kitware.com/) of CMake.

3. Install PostgreSQL development headers and other dependencies:

    ```
    export POSTGRES_VERSION=15
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        postgresql-server-dev-${POSTGRES_VERSION} \
        bison \
        build-essential \
        clang \
        cmake \
        flex \
        libclang-dev \
        libopenblas-dev \
        libpython3-dev \
        libreadline-dev \
        libssl-dev \
        pkg-config \
        python3-dev
    ```

4. Clone our git repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml && \
    cd postgresml && \
    git submodule update --init --recursive && \
    cd pgml-extension
    ```

5. Install [pgrx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgrx) and build the extension (this will take a few minutes):

    <strong>With Python:</strong>

    ```
    export POSTGRES_VERSION=15
    cargo install cargo-pgrx --version "0.9.8" --locked && \
    cargo pgrx init --pg15 pg_config && \
    cargo pgrx install
    ```

    <strong>Without Python:</strong>
    ```
    export POSTGRES_VERSION=15
    cp docker/Cargo.toml.no-python Cargo.toml && \
    cargo install cargo-pgrx --version "0.9.8" --locked && \
    cargo pgrx init --pg15 pg_config && \
    cargo pgrx install
    ```

=== "macOS"

1. Install the latest Rust compiler from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

2. Clone our git repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml && \
    cd postgresml && \
    git submodule update --init --recursive && \
    cd pgml-extension
    ```

3. Install PostgreSQL and other dependencies:
    ```
    brew install \
        llvm \
        postgresql@15 \
        cmake \
        openssl \
        pkg-config \
        openblas \
        libomp \
        virtualenv \
        python@3.11
    ```

4. Install [pgrx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgrx) and build the extension (this will take a few minutes):
    ```
    cargo install cargo-pgrx && \
    cargo pgrx init && \
    cargo pgrx install
    ```

===

### Enable the extension

#### Update postgresql.conf

PostgresML needs to be preloaded at server startup, so you need to add it into `shared_preload_libraries`:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pgml,pg_stat_statements'
```

If you're using a virtual environment for the Python packages, you also need to configure it via `pgml.venv`:

```
pgml.venv = '/absolute/path/to/the/venv'
```

=== "Ubuntu"

```bash
vim /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf
```

=== "macOS"

```bash
vim /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15/postgresql.conf
```

===

This setting change requires PostgreSQL to be restarted:

=== "Ubuntu"

```bash
sudo service postgresql restart
```

=== "macOS"

```bash
brew services restart postgresql@15
```

===


#### Install into database

!!! note

If you already have a v1.0 installation, see [Upgrading to v2.0](/docs/guides/setup/v2/upgrade-from-v1/).

!!!

Now that the extension is installed on your system, add it into the database where you'd like to use it:

!!! generic

!!! code_block title="SQL"

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgml;
```

!!!

!!! results

```
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pgml;
INFO:  Python version: 3.10.4 (main, Jun 29 2022, 12:14:53) [GCC 11.2.0]
INFO:  Scikit-learn 1.1.3, XGBoost 1.7.1, LightGBM 3.3.3, NumPy 1.23.5
CREATE EXTENSION
```

!!!

!!!

That's it, PostgresML is ready. You can validate the installation by running:

!!! generic

!!! code_block title="SQL"

```sql
SELECT pgml.version();
```

!!!

!!! results

```
postgres=# select pgml.version();
      version
-------------------
 2.7.1
(1 row)
```

!!!

!!!

## Run the dashboard

The dashboard is a web app that can be run against any Postgres database with the extension installed. There is a Dockerfile included with the source code if you wish to run it as a container. Basic installation can be achieved with:

1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already for the extension):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml && \
    cd postgresml/pgml-dashboard
    ```

2. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
    ```bash
    export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user_name:password@localhost:5432/database_name
    ```

3. Build and run the web application:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

The dashboard can be packaged for distribution. You'll need to copy the static files along with the `target/release` directory to your server.
