# PostgresML Dashboard

PostgresML provides a dashboard with analytical views of the training data and model performance, as well as integrated notebooks for rapid iteration. It is primarily written in Rust using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) as a lightweight web framework and [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) to interact with the database.

Please see the [quick start instructions](https://postgresml.org/docs/getting-started/sign-up) for general information on installing or deploying PostgresML. A [developer guide](https://postgresml.org/developer_guide/overview/) is also available for those who would like to contribute.
